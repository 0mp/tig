.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.nf
\fIcolor\fR \fIfgcolor\fR \fIbgcolor\fR \fI[attributes]\fR
.fi

.SH "DESCRIPTION"


You can permanently set an option by putting it in the ~/\&.tigrc file\&. The file consists of a series of \fIcommands\fR\&. Each line of the file may contain only one command\&.


The hash mark (\fI#\fR), or semi\-colon (\fI;\fR) is used as a \fIcomment\fR character\&. All text after the comment character to the end of the line is ignored\&. You can use comments to annotate your initialization file\&.

.SH "COLOR OPTIONS"


Color options control highlighting and the user interface styles\&. If your terminal supports color, these commands can be used to assign foreground/backgound combinations to certain areas\&. Optionally, an attribute can be given as the last parameter\&. The syntax is:

.nf
        \fIcolor\fR \fIarea\fR \fIfgcolor\fR \fIbgcolor\fR \fI[attributes]\fR
.fi


Valid colors include: \fIwhite\fR, \fIblack\fR, \fIgreen\fR, \fImagenta\fR, \fIblue\fR, \fIcyan\fR, \fIyellow\fR, \fIred\fR, \fIdefault\fR\&. Use \fIdefault\fR to refer to the default terminal colors\&.


Valid attributes include: \fInormal\fR, \fIblink\fR, \fIbold\fR, \fIdim\fR, \fIreverse\fR, \fIstandout\fR, and \fIunderline\fR\&. Note, not all attributes may be supported by the terminal\&.


Valid area names are described below\&. Note, all names are case\-insensitive, and you may use \fI\-\fR, \fI_\fR, and \fI\&.\fR interchangeably\&. So "Diff\-Header", "DIFF_HEADER", and "diff\&.header" are the same\&.

.SS "Diff markup"


Options concerning diff start, chunks and lines added and deleted\&.


\fIdiff\-header\fR, \fIdiff\-chunk\fR, \fIdiff\-add\fR, \fIdiff\-del\fR

.SS "Enhanced git diff markup"


Extra diff information emitted by the git diff machinery, such as mode changes, rename detection, and similarity\&.


\fIdiff\-oldmode\fR, \fIdiff\-newmode\fR, \fIdiff\-copy\-from\fR, \fIdiff\-copy\-to\fR, \fIdiff\-rename\-from\fR, \fIdiff\-rename\-to\fR, \fIdiff\-similarity\fR \fIdiff\-dissimilarity\fR \fIdiff\-tree\fR, \fIdiff\-index\fR

.SS "Pretty print commit headers"


Commit diffs and the revision logs are usually formatted using pretty printed headers , unless \-\-pretty=raw was given\&. This includes lines, such as merge info, commit ID, and author and comitter date\&.


\fIpp\-author\fR, \fIpp\-commit\fR, \fIpp\-merge\fR, \fIpp\-date\fR, \fIpp\-adate\fR, \fIpp\-cdate\fR

.SS "Raw commit header"


Usually shown when \-\-pretty=raw is given, however \fIcommit\fR is pretty much omnipresent\&.


\fIcommit\fR, \fIparent\fR, \fItree\fR, \fIauthor\fR, \fIcommitter\fR

.SS "Commit message"


For now only Signed\-off\-by lines are colorized\&.


\fIsignoff\fR

.SS "UI colors"


Colors for text not matching any of the above: \fIdefault\fR


Status window colors: \fIstatus\fR


Title window colors: \fItitle\-blur\fR, \fItitle\-focus\fR


Cursor line colors: \fIcursor\fR


Main view specific: \fImain\-date\fR, \fImain\-author\fR, \fImain\-commit\fR, \fImain\-delim\fR, \fImain\-tag\fR, \fImain\-ref\fR
