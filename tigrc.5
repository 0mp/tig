.SH "DESCRIPTION"
You can permanently set an option by putting it in the ~/\.tigrc file\. The file consists of a series of \fIcommands\fR\. Each line of the file may contain only one command\.
.sp
The hash mark (\fI#\fR) is used as a \fIcomment\fR character\. All text after the comment character to the end of the line is ignored\. You can use comments to annotate your initialization file\.

A few selective variables can be configured via the set command\. The syntax is:

The type of variables are either bool, int, and string\.
.PP
Valid bool values
.RS 4
To set a bool variable to true use either "1", "true", or "yes"\. Any other value will set the variable to false\.
.RE
.PP
Valid int values
.RS 4
A non\-negative integer\.
.RE
.PP
Valid string values
.RS 4
A string of characters\. Optionally, use either \' or " as delimiters\.
.RE
.SS "Variables"
The following variables can be set:
.PP
\fIshow\-author\fR (bool), \fIshow\-date\fR (bool), \fIshow\-rev\-graph\fR (bool), \fIshow\-refs\fR (bool)
.RS 4
Whether to show author, date, revision graph, and references (branches, tags, and remotes) in the main view on start\-up\. Can all be toggled\.
.RE
.PP
\fIline\-graphics\fR (bool)
.RS 4
Whether to use graphic characters for line drawing\.
.RE
.PP
\fIline\-number\-interval\fR (int)
.RS 4
Interval between line numbers\. Note, you have to toggle on line numbering with
\fIn\fR
or the
\-n
command line option\. The default is to number every line\.
.RE
.PP
\fItab\-size\fR (int)
.RS 4
Number of spaces per tab\. The default is 8 spaces\.
.RE
.PP
\fIcommit\-encoding\fR (string)
.RS 4
The encoding used for commits\. The default is UTF\-8\. Not this option is shadowed by the "i18n\.commitencoding" option in
\.git/config\.
.RE
.SH "BIND COMMAND"
Using bind commands keys can be mapped to an action when pressed in a given key map\. The syntax is:
.sp
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fBbind\fR \fIkeymap\fR \fIkey\fR \fIaction\fR
.fi
.RE
.sp
Examples:
.sp
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
# A few keybindings
bind main w scroll\-line\-up
bind main s scroll\-line\-down
bind main space enter
bind diff a previous
bind diff d next
bind diff b move\-first\-line
# \'unbind\' the default quit key binding
bind main Q none
# An external command to update from upstream
bind generic F !git fetch
# Cherry\-pick current commit unto current branch
bind generic C !git cherry\-pick %(commit)
.fi
.RE
.sp
Keys are mapped by first searching the keybindings for the current view, then the keybindings for the \fBgeneric\fR keymap, and last the default keybindings\. Thus, the view keybindings shadow the generic keybindings which Shadow the built\-in keybindings\.
.PP
Keymaps
.RS 4
Valid keymaps are:
\fBmain\fR,
\fBdiff\fR,
\fBlog\fR,
\fBhelp\fR,
\fBpager\fR,
\fBstatus\fR,
\fBstage\fR, and
\fBgeneric\fR\. Use
\fBgeneric\fR
to set key mapping in all keymaps\.
.RE
.PP
Key values
.RS 4
Key values should never be quoted\. Use either the ASCII value or one of the following symbolic key names\. Symbolic key names are case insensitive, Use
\fBHash\fR
to bind to the
#
key, since the hash mark is used as a comment character\.
.sp
\fBEnter\fR,
\fBSpace\fR,
\fBBackspace\fR,
\fBTab\fR,

Action names
.RS 4
Valid action names are described below\. Note, all names are case\-insensitive, and you may use
\fI\-\fR,
\fI_\fR, and
\fI\.\fR
interchangeably, e\.g\. "view\-main", "View\.Main", and "VIEW_MAIN" are the same\.
.RE
.SS "Actions"
Apart from the action names listed below, all actions starting with a \fI!\fR will be available as an external command\. External commands can contain variable names that will be substituted before the command is run\. Valid variable names are "%(head)", "%(commit)", and "%(blob)"\.
.sp
As an example, the following external command will save the current commit as a patch file: "!git format\-patch %(commit)^\.\.%(commit)"\.
